  "Hello, I’m Kate. As an Audit and Advisory Partner, I love working in the creative industries; enabling storytellers, content creators and editors to focus on their business, whilst trusting me and the team to look after the audit and accounting compliance and supporting their journey.",

  "Since joining Ecovis in 2007 I help creatives answer the question “how do I know what I need to know, when I don’t know I need to know it?” and am there every step of the way. From starting out (or perhaps walking out), through periods of high demand for their content and acceleration of their financial performance to an eventual exit, be that succession planning or weighing-up investment opportunities",

  "As Head of Media & Entertainment I am hugely passionate about supporting growing businesses and helping them realise their aspirational dreams. I am calm and conscientious, always available to help solve problems and help navigate tricky waters. I love nothing more than connecting with my peers, clients, team, contacts and competitors over a coffee or glass of wine.",

  " As an Audit Partner I take my responsibilities to help improve the standards of our profession seriously, and to ensure that we deliver what we say, when we say we will, with the utmost focus on quality, always."
